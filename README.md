# Finance Dashboard

A simple **Finance Dashboard** that serves as a central hub for three useful finance tools:

1. **PocketSave** — Track income, expenses, and savings goals.  
2. **Loan Helper** — Calculate loans and view amortization schedules.  
3. **EMI Calculator** — Compute monthly EMI, total interest, and total payment.

All apps run **locally in the browser** and do not require any backend or API keys (except the FRED API demo in PocketSave, which is optional).
